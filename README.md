## 📂 Detailed Modules

### 📋 Job Postings

The Job Postings module is the backbone of TalentFlow’s recruitment process. HR users can:
- Create new job listings with details such as:
  - Job title
  - Job description
  - Required skills and qualifications
  - Location and work type (remote or onsite)
  - Application deadlines
- Edit existing job listings if the requirements or job details change.
- Publish or archive job postings as per hiring needs.
- Categorize jobs by department, urgency, or role type.

This module helps recruiters clearly communicate expectations and attract suitable candidates. For example, you can create a listing for “Frontend Developer” with required skills like React and TypeScript, ensuring only relevant candidates apply.

### 👥 Candidate Management

The Candidate Management module ensures that every applicant’s journey is tracked and organized. Key functionalities include:
- Viewing candidate profiles with information such as:
  - Name, email, phone number
  - Resume or portfolio links
  - Application status (e.g., applied, shortlisted, interviewed, rejected)
- Filtering candidates based on applied jobs, skills, or assessment performance.
- Adding notes for interviews or interactions with candidates to streamline decision-making.
- Sending feedback or scheduling interviews from within the platform.

For instance, if you posted a job for a “UI Designer,” you can track all applicants, view their resumes, and shortlist the best ones based on their portfolios.

### ✅ Assessments

The Assessments module helps ensure candidates meet job requirements by providing:
- Customizable skill tests linked directly to specific job postings.
- Options to add multiple-choice questions, coding challenges, or scenario-based problems.
- Automated evaluation where possible, or manual review options by HR.
- Performance tracking, with reports and analytics showing candidate strengths and weaknesses.

This allows you to assess whether candidates have the required expertise before proceeding to interviews or offers. For example, a “Backend Developer” job can have tests on API development and database optimization.
